Part of my attempt at creating reinforcement learning AI to fly an fpv drone...
Still a work in progress, and putting it on github mainly for future reference. 

Tried using PPO, and the basis for object detection based flight control is there, but yet to be fully implemented.

Things I used/were helpful: 
* Tensorflow
* [GymFC](https://github.com/wil3/gymfc)
* [pyMultiWii](https://github.com/alduxvm/pyMultiWii)
* [Tensorflow object detection](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-on-the-Raspberry-Pi)

used an mhq2 model drone with naze32 flight controller running baseflight, with a raspberry pi 2 strapped above and connected to a picamera...
